This assignment focused on analyzing data from ten different drug regimen trials focusing on anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. This particular study was concerning potential treatments for squamous cell carinoma, a commonly occuring form of skin cancer. It was conducted over a period of forty-five days. Given full access to the complete data, we were tasked with comparing a particular drug, Capomulin with other treatment regimens. All requested tables and figures were plotted for the technical report of the study as well as some summary findings as outlined below.

Observations and Insights

###The following observations regarding the mouse drug regimen study of the ten drugs(including placebo) over a period of 45 days:
There did seem to be a correlation with mice treated with the Capomulin regime and their weights and average tumor volumes. The correlation coefficient is 0.84, indicating a strong correlation. Thus, a heavier mouse generally exhibited larger average tumor volumes.

Timepoint measurements over the course of the study suggest the mice treated with Capomulin and Ramicane performed similarly well in life span over the treatment. They had the lengthiest spans compared to other treatments. Seven of the treatments generally didn't seem to perform any better than the placebo in this regard.

Capmulin and Ramicane also seemed to demonstrate the lowest average tumor volumes at the final timepoints for the mice in the study as compared to other drugs(and placebo). The median final tumor volume of Capomulin treated mice was: 38.125164 and the median final tumor volume of Ramicane treated mice was 36.561652. An examination of individual mice treated with Capomulin seem to demonstrate lower tumor volumes by their final timepoint over the course of the study as compared to their tumor volume at the start of the study.
